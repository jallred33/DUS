*Q: What is the purpose of this course?*

A: English 285 is an *introduction* to creative writing. Accordingly, it combines further development of the close reading skills across genres cultivated in ENGL 220 with development of creative writing skills through weekly writing assignments in poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction. Students will also engage in verbal workshop critiques of classmates’ work that draws on critical reading skills developed through discussion of literary selections. In addition to critiquing the work of peers, students will practice frequent and thorough revision of their own work. Finally, students will complete a final project consisting of one piece in each genre and a written reflection on the writing process.

*Q: What are the differences between English 285 and other creative writing courses in the major?*

A: English 285 serves a crucial role as a gateway. All creative writing concentrators must earn a "B" or better in the course in order to continue in the concentration. They must also gain enough mastery of the three genres featured in the concentration to succeed in future workshops with more intensive focus and heavier workload in a single genre.


*Q: How do you balance the close reading of "model" texts by published authors and the workshops with student work?*

A: Most instructors cluster the "reading" sessions at the beginning and the "workshop" sessions at the end, with a rough 50/50 split. Most also move through the genres serially in each half of the course (e.g., poetry, then fiction, then creative nonfiction, both for the readings and for the workshops). 

*Q: What's the best way to assess learning in this course?*

A: Approaches vary greatly, so peruse the many sample syllabi in the Commons Group under FILES. But a few overarching principles are common to successful syllabi:

* use a portfolio system, requiring students to compile, present, and reflect on what they view at their best work for the term.
* require frequent, low-stakes writing throughout the term. This need not always be graded and given feedback, beyond a check to ensure the work is complete. But constant, informal writing and reflection is essential to building skills in this course.
* whatever your criteria, include them clearly in the syllabus, and make sure your numbers add up and reflect your priorities in the course. 
* be sure that your syllabus gives students a clear sense of the specific assignments that they will be writing, the percentage that each assignment is worth towards the final grade and when each assignment is due.
* include all policies, for example, your policy on absences, lateness, and lateness of work, and academic dishonesty and/or plagiarism. This protects and empowers both you and your students.

*Q: Are there specific policies that must be incorporated into my syllabus?*

A: All syllabi must include the “Learning Outcomes” you deem appropriate for 285 along with the standard language for Academic Integrity, and Policy on Sexual Misconduct. For the specific language for the latter two requirements, plus best practices for all syllabi at Hunter, check out [the Hunter College Faculty Senate's excellent guide](https://www.hunter.cuny.edu/artsci/repository/files/documents-and-forms/curriculum-templates/Required%20Syllabus%20Information.docx).

*Q: What resources do I have access to as an instructor?*

A: Please visit the [285 instructors’ group page](https://commons.gc.cuny.edu/groups/intro-to-creative-writing-hunter/) on the CUNY Academic Commons, where you will find sample syllabi, course units, and so on. I encourage you to post your own helpful documents to this page, and contact me if you have problems joining or using the group. [ACERT](https://acert.hunter.cuny.edu/), Hunter’s center for teaching and learning, is a lively hub linking instructors, librarians, ed tech specialists, etc.: their site has a wealth of teaching resources, and they host scores of events on pedagogy each year.

*Q: What are my options in terms of “learning management systems” (LMS)? Do I have to use BlackBoard or Brightspace?!*

A: You are free to use whatever you’re comfortable with. By default, all courses get Bb shells (or Brightspace from AY 2024-5), which you are free to customize/use. But there are many alternatives, including free/open options based on the WordPress blogging platform. Instructors can now host course materials on CUNY Academic Commons sites like this one: there are hundreds of sites to browse there for inspiration.
